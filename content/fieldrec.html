          This portable field recorder, built around a Teensy 4.1, will sample and store ambient audio to an onboard SD card, then feed selected clips into a custom-trained ML model that dynamically weaves them into an evolving ambient soundscape. The goal is to capture and replay “field memories” in real time, both on the device and via exported files for deeper off-device exploration.

        I aim to design a battery-powered Teensy 4.1 enclosure with a high-quality microphone and SD card slot. In recording mode, it will sample environmental sounds and save them as WAV files. A user interface—likely a set of buttons and a small OLED—will let you flag which clips to send to the ML engine.

        Research is ongoing into training a lightweight neural network capable of taking those flagged samples as input and generating a continuous soundscape that evolves based on audio features like timbre, rhythm, and volume. The Teensy will run inference locally where possible, blending new recordings into the playback stream. All generated and raw files will remain accessible on the SD card for later transfer and deeper analysis or remixing on a desktop.
