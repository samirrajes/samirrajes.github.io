        Qollapse is an autonomous simulation that explores identity as something relational, unstable,
        and historically shaped rather than fixed or pre-defined. A single “Seeker” agent exists in a
        superposition of possible relational roles, collapsing into a specific identity only through
        observation and interaction with others. Over time, patterns of behaviour, attachment,
        hesitation, and stability emerge—not by script, but through accumulated encounters inside a
        living world.

      The project was developed as my MSc Creative Computing thesis at the University of the Arts
      London. It combines agent-based simulation, interpersonal psychology, and quantum-inspired
      decision models to examine how identity forms through repeated social encounters rather than
      static internal traits.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
      Four classical agents—Mother, Sage, Peer, and Lover—are modelled using a six-dimensional
      interpersonal trait space. Their behaviours are stable but mutable, drifting gradually as they
      interact with others. In contrast, the Seeker’s identity is represented as a quantum-inspired
      superposition over four relational roles: Child, Disciple, Friend, and Partner. Observation by
      others rotates this potential identity state, while interaction causes it to collapse into a
      specific role for that moment.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
      These dynamics are implemented in Unity using a lightweight C# port of MicroQiskit to handle
      state vectors, rotations, entanglement-like coupling, and probabilistic collapse. The simulation
      runs continuously, generating unscripted behaviour shaped by spatial layout, day–night cycles,
      and the order in which encounters occur. Identity emerges as a trajectory rather than an
      endpoint.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
      Qollapse includes an integrated narrative layer that exposes internal processes—observations,
      role collapses, actions, and trait shifts—as a live textual log. Long-run simulations are logged
      to CSV and analysed offline using Python, producing trait-drift plots, circumplex trajectories,
      collapse matrices, and spatial density maps. These visualisations reveal consistent global
      attractors alongside role-specific identity paths: secure, oscillatory, hesitant, or highly
      regulated.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
      Rather than presenting identity as something an agent “has,” Qollapse treats identity as
      something that happens: a process enacted through relation, context, and time. The project
      functions both as a research prototype and as an open-ended world—an environment designed
      to think with, observe, and potentially break.
