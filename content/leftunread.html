          Left Unread is a browser-based generative art piece that repurposes four years of personal text messages into unpredictable, poem-adjacent sentences via a one-word Markov model. Emotionally charged words are detected with a custom AFINN lexicon and transformed into abstract asemic graphics, inviting reflection on how machines mediate our speech and how much remains unseen in digital

        Left Unread starts with Python scripts that parse exported chat logs. Regular expressions redact personal names, strip out links and insert missing punctuation. The cleaned corpus feeds a 1-gram model that selects each next word based solely on the current one. This choice produces spontaneous, occasionally absurd sentences that capture the uncertainty of real-time speech and critique the over-polished output of modern language models.

        Once text is generated, each word is scored using a locally stored AFINN lexicon extended with personal slang and abbreviations. Words exceeding an emotional threshold trigger an asemic transformation stage. Letter shapes are sampled into point clouds, shuffled and reassembled into textured visual forms. This process mirrors the black-box nature of neural networks, where original data is hidden in a latent dimension.

        The front end is implemented in p5.js. It renders text in real time using a pixelated font and scanline overlay that evoke early CRT terminals. A blinking cursor and subtle pauses between words mimic human typing rhythms. A simple state machine manages continuous generation, drawing each new word or asemic glyph to the canvas as soon as it emerges from the model.

        By combining a minimal n-gram approach with sentiment-driven graphics and a nostalgic visual style, Left Unread creates a living installation. It asks how many genuine messages will never be seen amid the flood of machine-mediated content and celebrates the messy, unpredictable beauty of human language.
