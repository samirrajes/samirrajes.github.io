          Echo is an interactive kinetic sculpture that turns your silhouette into a living, shifting relief. A camera and MediaPipe segmentation break your form into a simple 7×7 grid, sending push–pull commands to 49 servos hidden behind stretched fabric. As the rods press and release in real time, your image appears and dissolves, inviting reflection on how we see and share ourselves in the age of selfies and surveillance.

      Echo begins with a webcam feed processed in TouchDesigner using a MediaPipe segmentation model to separate a visitor’s body from the background. The silhouette is downsampled to a 7×7 grid of binary states, where each pixel represents either a “push” (servo forward) or “pull” (servo back). This 49-bit array is streamed via serial to an Arduino Mega, which controls three daisy-chained 16-channel PWM driver boards.

        Each channel drives a micro servo connected to a laser-cut plywood crank and guide rail. The crank translates rotational movement into a linear push, moving a polystyrene-tipped rod that presses against the fabric surface. The fabric’s stretch and the rod tips’ texture help create a soft-edged, tactile impression of the silhouette.

        The mechanism was intentionally designed with servos rather than silent actuators to produce a subtle rhythmic clicking, adding an audible layer to the experience. The frame and mounts are precision laser-cut plywood, sanded and reinforced to prevent warping or sag under the system’s weight.

        Building Echo required balancing live video processing latency, servo response time, and mechanical limits to ensure a smooth, responsive display. The final installation offers both an immediate visual impact and a deeper commentary on the merging of human presence with machine interpretation, drawing inspiration from Daniel Rozin’s mechanical mirrors.
