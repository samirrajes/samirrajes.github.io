          This sketch explores asemic writing inspired by the visual flow of Devanagari script, particularly the shirorekha—the horizontal line connecting characters across a word. Using p5.js, it generates structured yet unreadable “text,” with each character built from sampled control points and layered strokes to emulate the texture of ink on paper. The goal was to create forms that feel like part of a coherent writing system while remaining purely abstract.

        Characters are generated by sampling control points within an elliptical region, ensuring a tall, narrow form. One control point per character is fixed at the same y-position to anchor the shirorekha, which is drawn as a multi-layered, slightly noisy curve connecting the characters of a word. Words are assembled from a random number of characters, spaced horizontally and arranged into lines of text across the page.

        The textured, organic look comes from redrawing each character multiple times with subtle Gaussian offsets to stroke positions, creating the impression of uneven ink flow. Occasional red words introduce variation in an otherwise black composition. The background is further broken up with faint, random lines to mimic paper grain.

        By blending a mathematically consistent generative structure with stochastic imperfections, the piece balances order and irregularity—suggesting a plausible but wholly invented script that invites interpretation without offering meaning.
