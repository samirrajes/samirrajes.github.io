          The Wired is a work-in-progress network-driven simulation built in Unreal Engine that treats every IP address on the local network as an autonomous agent. Packet metadata—protocol, size, timing and content—dictates how agents interact, creating a unique, evolving digital ecosystem inspired by Serial Experiments Lain and Ian Cheng’s emissaries trilogy.

        At its core The Wired captures the invisible flow of data all around us and makes it manifest as an emergent virtual world. We use Wireshark to sniff live network traffic, parsing packet headers and payload characteristics in TouchDesigner. That pre-processed data is streamed via OSC into Unreal Engine, where each unique IP becomes an agent whose behavior is governed by packet activity—DNS lookups spawn exploratory movement, large file transfers trigger resource-focused tasks, and unusual protocols manifest as unpredictable interactions.

        Character models and environments are being developed in Blender with a visual style that echoes the grainy, neon-lined aesthetic of Serial Experiments Lain. Custom HLSL shaders recreate its scanline noise, phosphor glow, and abstract data-stream motifs. Because the project is still in development we continue to refine the data-to-behavior mapping, optimize real-time data transfer pipelines, and explore how device type (mobile, desktop, IoT) can influence agent traits. Ultimately The Wired aims to surface questions of privacy, surveillance and how our devices quietly shape collective digital behavior.
